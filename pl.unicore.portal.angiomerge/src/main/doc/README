AngioMerge plugin for the UNICORE portal


Installation:
 - Make sure that the portal version is compatible with this module. 
   Supported portal version is in the pom.xml file (in the <properties> element).
 - Copy the sole jar file to the portal lib directory.

Configuration:
 - portal.angiomerge.grantsAttribute - [default value is 'grants'], this property should be set to a name of 
 user's attribute (as retrieved from Unity) with allowed grants. If user has no such attribute then UI provides
 a plain text field to manually type the grant name. If the attribute is present then its values are put into
 the grant selection combo box. Note: the attribute must be multi-valued (NOT a single value, with grants separated 
 with space or comma).
